# Rosetta-snippets-cli
cli application for rosetta, it opens the webpage from the search term and also goes to the specific language

##NOTE -- Little sketchup and it actually works nice, but there is some code inside which doesn't work and is not that pretty, I made it in a few hours

```sh
$ go get github.com/barthr/rosetta
```

### Example
```sh
rosetta search hello
```

After entering the search u will be prompted to choose one from the selection


### Work in progress
- Adding language support (almost done not working good yet)
- Caching
